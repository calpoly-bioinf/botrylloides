## Abstract
Ascidians have the potential to reveal fundamental biological insights related to coloniality, regeneration, immune function, and the evolution of these traits. This study implements a hybrid assembly technique with cost-effective sequencing to produce a genome assembly and annotation for the botryllid ascidian, _Botrylloides violaceus_. A hybrid genome assembly was produced using Illumina, Inc. short and Oxford Nanopore Technologies long read sequencing technologies. The resulting assembly is comprised of 831 contigs, has a total length of 121 Mbp, N50 of 1 Mbp and a BUSCO score of 96.1%. Genome annotation identified ~13,000 protein coding genes. Comparative genomic analysis with other tunicates reveals patterns of conservation and divergence within orthologous gene families even among closely related species. Characterization of the _Wnt_ gene family, encoding signaling ligands involved in development and regeneration, reveals conserved patterns of subfamily presence and gene copy number among botryllids. This study supports the use of genomic data from non-model organisms in the investigation of biological phenomena.
